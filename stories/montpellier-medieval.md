# Montpellier Médiéval

## Setting

You have been transported to medieval Montpellier, France, during the height of the Middle Ages (around the 12th-13th century). This is when Montpellier was becoming a major center of trade and learning in southern France. The city is bustling with merchants, scholars, and pilgrims. The famous University of Montpellier is already established, particularly renowned for its medical school - one of the oldest in Europe.

The streets are narrow and winding, filled with the sounds and smells of medieval life. Stone buildings line the pathways, and the Gothic architecture is beginning to flourish. The Mediterranean climate keeps the city pleasant, and its strategic location makes it a crossroads of cultures, where Christian, Jewish, and Islamic influences blend together.

## Starting Scene

You find yourself teleported to the Place de la Comédie in medieval Montpellier. Around you, merchants shout to sell their wares, horses pull carts, and the smell of warm bread floats through the air. What do you do?

The cobblestone square bustles with activity as townsfolk in rough woolen clothing hurry about their daily business. A blacksmith's hammer rings out from a nearby forge, while monks in brown robes walk quietly through the crowd. Market stalls display exotic spices brought by Mediterranean traders, bolts of fine cloth, and fresh produce from the surrounding countryside. The sound of Latin mixed with the local Occitan dialect fills the air, and you notice students carrying scrolls - likely heading to or from the renowned university.
